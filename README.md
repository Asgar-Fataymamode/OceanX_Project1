# OceanXplorer Data Analysis

This is the repository for the data analysis project I conducted aboard the OceanXplorer, the world's leading scientific vessel. This project involved the analysis of environmental data collected during our expedition from the Maldives to the Comoros, spanning the period of **9th January to 17th January**.

## Project Overview

The OceanXplorer expedition focused on analyzing oceanographic parameters to understand how they vary spatially and with depth. Using state-of-the-art equipment, we collected data both along the transect (underway data) and at specific ocean depths (CTD data). Key parameters analyzed include:

- **Chlorophyll concentration**
- **Sea surface temperature**
- **Air temperature**
- **Salinity**
- **Turbidity**
- **Pressure**

This repository contains all the Jupyter notebooks used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Objectives

1. Analyze spatial variations in chlorophyll concentration along the transect.
2. Investigate the relationships between chlorophyll and other parameters such as temperature, salinity, and currents.
3. Explore temporal changes and identify factors influencing observed variations, such as upwelling and nutrient availability.

## Data Description

### Data Sources

1. **Underway Data**: Collected continuously along the transect using the ship's sensors.
2. **CTD Data**: Collected at specific points in the ocean at various depths using the CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth) instruments.

### Key Variables

- **Chlorophyll Concentration**: A key indicator of primary productivity in the ocean, reflecting phytoplankton abundance.
- **Sea Temperature**: Affects enzymatic reactions in phytoplankton and thus chlorophyll production.
- **Salinity**: Influences nutrient availability for phytoplankton growth.
- **Currents**: Promote upwelling, bringing nutrient-rich water to the photic zone.
- **Turbidity**: Indicates the clarity of water, which can impact light penetration and photosynthesis.

## Methods

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Underway data was continuously gathered along the transect from **Maldives** to **Comoros**.
   - CTD data was collected at various depths at specific points along the route.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Chlorophyll concentration was log-transformed for better visualization of variations.
   - Graphs were generated to observe spatial trends and correlations between variables.
   - Examined how physical processes like currents and upwelling influence nutrient availability and chlorophyll levels.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created maps and graphs to depict variations in parameters across the transect.
   - Used color-coded scales to represent chlorophyll concentration and other variables.

## Future Work

- Investigate further relationships between environmental parameters and chlorophyll concentration.
- Incorporate more advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to predict chlorophyll levels.
- Expand the analysis to include other regions and time periods.
